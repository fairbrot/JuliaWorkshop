# Julia for Statistics and Operational Research

The materials in this repository were used at workshop on the Julia programming which took place 9-10th June 2016.
Additional sessions on the use of Julia for statistics were lead by Theodore Papamarkou and the materials for these, as well as some tutorials used in the introductory session can be found [here](https://github.com/scidom/JuliaByExample.jl).
